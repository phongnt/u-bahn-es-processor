# Verification

**NOTE** - For all kafka message below, update the topic to be the one set in config.UBAHN_AGGREGATE_TOPIC and inside the payload object, create a new attribute named `originalTopic` with the value of the original topic. Example:

```json
{
  "topic": "u-bahn.action.aggregate",
  "originator": "u-bahn-api",
  "timestamp": "2019-07-08T00:00:00.000Z",
  "mime-type": "application/json",
  "payload": {
    "originalTopic": "u-bahn.action.create",
    "resource": "user",
    "id": "391a3656-9a01-47d4-8c6d-64b68c44f212",
    "handle": "user"
  }
}
```

Additionally, you will be entering the messages into only one topic:

```bash
docker exec -it ubahn-data-processor-es_kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic u-bahn.action.aggregate
```

1. start kafka server, start elasticsearch, initialize Elasticsearch, start processor app
2. start kafka-console-producer to write messages to `u-bahn.action.create`

  `docker exec -it ubahn-data-processor-es_kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic u-bahn.action.create`
